    Description of GameState and helper functions:

    A GameState specifies the full game state, including the food, capsules,
    agent configurations and score changes. In this function, the |gameState| argument
    is an object of GameState class. Following are a few of the helper methods that you
    can use to query a GameState object to gather information about the present state
    of Pac-Man, the ghosts and the maze.

    gameState.getLegalActions(agentIndex):
        Returns the legal actions for the agent specified. Returns Pac-Man's legal moves by default.

    gameState.generateSuccessor(agentIndex, action):
        Returns the successor state after the specified agent takes the action.
        Pac-Man is always agent 0.

    gameState.getPacmanState():
        Returns an AgentState object for pacman (in game.py)
        state.configuration.pos gives the current position
        state.direction gives the travel vector

    gameState.getGhostStates():
        Returns list of AgentState objects for the ghosts

    gameState.getNumAgents():
        Returns the total number of agents in the game

    gameState.getScore():
        Returns the score corresponding to the current state of the game


    The GameState class is defined in pacman.py and you might want to look into that for
    other helper methods, though you don't need to.
